1️⃣ Behavior

Each method is wrapped individually.

If a method raises an exception:

The exception is caught by safe_function.

A rich panel with the error, cause, and suggestions is displayed.

The method returns None instead of crashing.

Program continues after that method call:

Any other methods you call afterward will run normally.

But execution inside the failed method does not resume; lines after the exception are skipped.
